    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people seemed more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "More Information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will investigate the dataset and explore who the passengers were and if some were more likely to survive than the others. Some of the questions that this dataset could answer are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How did gender and class affect survival?\n",
    "2. How did traveling alone vs traveling with spouse/children affect chances of survival? \n",
    "3. Were younger children more/less likely to survive than older ones?\n",
    "4. How did the survival statistics for children traveling with nannies compare to children traveling with their parents?\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's take a look what this dataset looks like.\n",

    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the Titanic Dataset provides some interesting insights into who the passengers were and how their chances of survival were affected by various factors. The findings of this data analysis though tentative could be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Out of the total 891 passengers in this dataset, 342 survived which is 38.38%.\n",
    "2. The mean age of passengers aboard the ship was 29.69 years.\n",
    "3. The youngest passenger was an infant < 1 year old while the oldest passenger was 80 years old.\n",
    "4. Gender considerably affected a person's chance of survival. Women were 4 times more likely than men to survive. \n",
    "5. Passengers in first class had the greatest chance of survival followed in by second and then third class. Passengers in first class were 2.7 times more likely to survive than passengers in third class.\n",
    "5. Passengers traveling with family had a greater chance of survival than those traveling alone.\n",
    "7. Younger children were not more or less likely than older children to survive. There was no particular trend observed.\n",
    "8. No significant difference was observed in the chance of survival for children traveling with parents vs children traveling with nannies. But overall, children had a survival rate of 53.98%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are however a few limitations of this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 177 Age values were missing and were not considered in the analysis. That may have skewed the calculations.\n",
    "2. The information in the Parch column refers to both parents and children combined. If this data was separately available it may have been possible to analyse how survival rate of men and women was affected when they were traveling with their children.\n",
    "3. Most information from the Cabin column is missing, to draw any useful insights about how cabin location may have impacted survival.\n",
    "4. A child is assumed to be someone > 18 years of age. The definition of a child may have been different in those days. If a child is considered of Age < 14 for example, it may change some of the conclusions we have drawn.\n"
