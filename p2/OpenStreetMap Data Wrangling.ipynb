    "The data for Albany, NY area was cleaned and street names, postal codes and city data was validated for accuracy. Some basic statistics about the data were obtained and additional exploration about popular cuisines, pizza places, fast food chains etc. was done.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Additional Ideas for improving OSM</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "After this review, it's seen that the data for Albany area is incomplete, though I believe it's been well cleaned for this exercise. Some additional ideas that I came across which can be implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>While looking at Stewart Shops in the area, I found that some shops were missing the city field. This also seems to be the case for other entries. Data entries should be validated for completeness.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Subway and Subway Subs point to the same chain but are listed separately. This data can be cleaned up.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Pizza Hut is listed as both pizza and fast food. This information should be standardized.</li>\n",
    "  <li>The timestamps of entries can be further analysed to find out how recent the data is, and how frequently it is being contributed to. This could help contributors to find where there is most need of updating the data.</li>\n",
    "</ul>  \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Benefits and anticipated problems</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardizing the data on openstreetmap.org and validating it for correctness and completeness will make the data more useful and accessible to customers, increasing it's popularity too. It will bring it at par with other popular map services like Google or Bing Maps which in turn will help improve the data, as more people would contribute to the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "But since OSM is run entirely by volunteers, doing this could be more challenging. For example, it may not be practical to physically verify latest location information. Or to obtain missing information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing some methods of cross validation might help. So would encouraging creation of better bots/scripts to import data to OSM.\n",
